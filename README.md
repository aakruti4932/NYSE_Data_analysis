# NYSE_Data_analysis

- In this project we analyze real life data from the New York stock exchange. 
- Here I used a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P companies.

# Skills which I used for this project.

1) Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
2) Use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions 
   (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP).
3) Analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Google Sheets.
4) create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.

# Attachement

- Readme file for project details.
- Pdf file for presentation review (also attached link for google sheet).
- Excel file downloaded from google sheets which contains all the data.

# Introduction to the project which contains three task.

- Task 1
1) Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis and include this in your slide presentation.
Your question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics.
A tab within the spreadsheet that you submit should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range)] you used to answer your question.
Deliverable:

2) Your slide presentation should provide at least one visualization to help support your answer.
Make a copy of the submission template to complete your project. We suggest you use the layout provided, though it is not a requirement. You can find the MS Powerpoint version of the Project Submission template under the Resources.
Once you have finished analyzing the data, in the submission template provided, create your presentation that shares the visual and summary information.
The summary information paragraph clearly communicates your findings based on your analysis and provides visual or numeric values associated with your summary.
The visualization(s) might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box-plot, or other visual that you learned to make. Include your insights from the measures of center and spread and at least one numeric summary statistic in the summary description.
Deliverable: Slide presentation (includes visualization)

- Task 2
1) Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. Include all companies from the raw data.
Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement

- Task 3
1) Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case).
Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin should change for each scenario.
The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.
